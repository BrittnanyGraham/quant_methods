Welcome to Applied Quantitative Methods
=======================================

This is the teaching materials for the course Applied Quantitative Methods. The
course is aim at developing a small set of core skills in quantitative methods,
and providing students an opportunity to apply these tools towards their own
projects.

Everything is open source (MIT) and open access (CC-BY) licensed, so please feel
free to use these materials in your own classes and contribute changes if you
see things that need improving.

I plan to add a better front-end webpage to provide better access to these
teaching materials, but for now this repo serves the purpose. Please see the
[syllabus](syllabus.md]) for more information about the course.
