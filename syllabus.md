**_Class time_** - Our time in class will be used primarily for 1) learning
new quantitative methods, 2) working on exercises, 3) presenting to the rest of
the class, and 4)

**_Students with Disabilities and Special Needs_** - The College will make
reasonable accommodations for persons with documented disabilities. If you have
a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are
encouraged to contact the Center for Disability Services (CDS/SNAP program)
located in the Lightsey Center, Suite 104, 953-1431, SNAP@cofc.edu. If you have
a documented disability and need accommodations, please come talk with me and
bring your Professor Notification Letter (PNL) as soon as possible. SNAP
students are requested to make arrangements with the instructors well in advance
of exams.

**_Academic integrity_** – Academic integrity is essential at the College of
Charleston and to the practice of science.  You will therefore be held to a high
standard of integrity in this course.  Plagiarism, lying, cheating or attempted
cheating are violations of the College’s honor code.  Any honor code violations
that occur will be handled as outlined in the student handbook.  Please be
absolutely sure that you understand what the honor code requires of you (see
pages 10-12 of the student handbook,
http://cofc.edu/generaldocuments/handbook.pdf).   If you have any questions or
concerns about honor code expectations or about how to avoid violations, please
consult with the instructor.

**_Plagiarism_** - Plagiarism is any use of words or ideas produced by another
person without proper attribution, and includes failing to paraphrase
adequately or to cite sources properly.  Plagiarism, both intentional and
unintentional, is forbidden by the honor code.  Please consult the instructor
if you have any questions or concerns about how to use and cite sources to
avoid plagiarism.

**_Collaboration_** - Many of your discussion projects will involve working with
other students.  Nevertheless, the work you submit must be completed
independently and must represent your own independent ideas, unless the
instructor specifically requires a joint product.  Please be sure that you
understand the distinction between collaborating and copying; ask your
instructor if you have any doubts. Suspicions of unauthorized collaboration will
be dealt with according to the honor code.

**_Re-using work_** - Please be aware that using work that you or anyone else
 has done for this or any other class or project, either in whole or in part, is
 a violation of the honor code, even if the work is revised.  Biology 211
 instructors keep copies of assignments submitted by students in previous
 semesters, and reuse or revision of such will result in reporting to the Dean
 of Students.
