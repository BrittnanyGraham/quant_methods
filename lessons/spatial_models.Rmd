The goals of this lesson are to introduce how spatial dependendence is tested 
for and how it can be corrected for or explained in uni- and multi-variate 
modeling frameworks. 

## Readings

* The R Book p778-785 on Generalized Least Squares models with spatially
correlated errors
* Numerical Ecology in R, p228-238 on detecting spatial dependence.

## Outline

* Detecting spatial dependence
* Univariate modeling
* Multivariate modeling
