## Overview of ordination methods

There are generally considered to be two types of ordination. 

1. Indirect or unconstrained ordination in which only a single matrix is analyzed
2. Direct or constrained ordination in which one matrix is used to explain the 
variance of another matrix. 

Today we will demonstrate both types. In general ordination is frequenty used
when exploring patterns in datasets and has particular strengths when graphed. 

The term ordination derives from the idea to ordinate or put things into order.
With ordination approaches were are attempting to take high-deminstional 
data matrix and explain their patterns with a small number of most important
dimensions.

Despite their sometimes terrifying names ordination has a close kinship with 
multiple regression. One key difference is that the response variable is 
multivariate rather than univariate; however, with many approaches the underlying
algebra is very similar between regression and ordindation.

The [Ordination methods table](http://dmcglinn.github.io/quant_methods/lessons/ordination_methods_table)
provides a simple overview for some of the more popular ordination approaches. 

Additionally this [key](http://ordination.okstate.edu/key.htm) created by Mike
Palmer provides a decision tree that can help to guide your choice of methods.

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
# setup the R enviornment for kniting markdown doc properly
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(root.dir='../')
```

## Create a community matrix
```{r}
# load relevant packages and code for today's lesson
library(vegan)
source('./scripts/cleanplot.pca.R')

# load data
trees = read.csv('./data/treedata.csv')
# create a community site x species matrix
comm = tapply(trees$cover, INDEX = list(trees$plotID, trees$spcode), sum)
# In class excercise 1:
# How could you construct a site x species matrix using a for loop?

# examine the community matrix
comm[1:5, 1:5]
# replace the NAs with zeros
comm = ifelse(is.na(comm), 0, comm)
comm[1:5, 1:5]
# visually explore the cover variable between species and sites
sp_sum = apply(comm, 2, sum)
site_sum = apply(comm, 1, sum)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(sp_sum)
plot(sp_sum[order(sp_sum, decreasing=T)], type='o', col='red', lwd=2,
     xlab='Sp Rank', ylab='Sum Cover')
hist(site_sum)
plot(site_sum[order(site_sum, decreasing=T)], type='o', col='red', lwd=2,
     xlab='Site Rank', ylab='Sum Cover')
```

## Create an explanatory matrix
```{r}
head(trees)
cols_to_keep = c('utme', 'utmn', 'elev', 'tci', 'streamdist', 'disturb', 'beers')
env = aggregate(trees[ , cols_to_keep], by = list(trees$plotID), function(x) x[1])
head(env)
# drop first column and make it a row name
row.names(env) = env[ , 1]
env = env[ , -1]
head(env)

# Am I missing anything...?
# In class Excercise 2: ... 
```

## Indirect or Unconstrained Ordination
### Principle Components Analysis (PCA)
```{r}
# PCA on enviornmental data
# must drop categorical variable
env_scaled = scale(env[ , names(env) != 'disturb'])
#rda(env_scaled)
#rda(env_scaled, na.action = na.omit)
#env_pca = rda(env_scaled, subset=!is.na(disturb))

tree_pca = rda(comm, scale=TRUE)
plot(tree_pca)
biplot(tree_pca)
cleanplot.pca(tree_pca)
# p120-121 of Numerical Ecology in R:
# Scaling 1 = distance biplot: the eigenvectors are scaled to unit length. (1)
# Distances among objects in the biplot are approximations of their
# Euclidean distances in multidimensional space. (2) The angles among
# descriptor vectors are meaningless.
# Scaling 2 = correlation biplot: each eigenvector is scaled to the square root of
# its eigenvalue. (1) Distances among objects in the biplot are not approximations
# of their Euclidean distances in multidimensional space. (2) The angles
# between descriptors in the biplot reflect their correlations.
```

### Correspondance Anlysis (CA), Detrended Coresspondance Analysis (DCA), and NMDS

```{r}
tree_ca = cca(comm)
tree_dca = decorana(comm)
tree_mds = metaMDS(comm, trymax = 5)
```

* Direct or Constrained Ordination
    - Redundancy Analysis (RDA)
    - Cononical Correspondance Analysis (CCA)
    - Hypothesis Testing
    - Model Comparison
    - Variance partitioning
