This course is taught using the R statistical programming language. 

**R** is a free, open-source software package that can be downloaded here:

In this course I will use the free **Rstudio** GUI to interact with R, it can be 
downloaded here:

We will also use **git** as our version control system for this course. Git can 
be downloaded here:

an appointment. Alternatively use the [Rstudio server](uniola.biology.cofc.edu:8787)
