## Spatial modeling assignment

```{r}
library(vegan)
library(BiodiversityR)
data(BCI)
data(BCI.env)
head(BCI)
head(BCI.env)
```

1) Examine if there is evidence of spatial dependence in a rare and a common
species in the BCI tree dataset


2) Model the species richness of the trees using the available enviornmental
information (not the spatial coordinates). 
Are the errors of this model still spatially autocorrelated?

3) Model species composition using the enviornmental data and an RDA. 
Does the environment explain the degree of spatial dependence observed
