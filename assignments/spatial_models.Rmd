## Spatial modeling assignment

```{r}
library(vegan)
library(BiodiversityR)
data(BCI)
data(BCI.env)
head(BCI)
head(BCI.env)
```

1) Examine if there is evidence of spatial dependence in a rare and a common
species in the BCI tree dataset


2) Use the tallgrass prairie dataset to examine spatial dependence in richness.
Model the species richness of the plants using the available enviornmental
information (not the spatial coordinates). 
Are the errors of this model still spatially autocorrelated?

```{r}
tgp = read.csv('./data/tgpp.csv')
# only look at the 100 m2 spatial grain
tgp = subset(tgp, subset=scale==100)
```

3) Model species composition using the enviornmental data with TGP and an RDA. 
Does the environment explain the degree of spatial dependence observed
