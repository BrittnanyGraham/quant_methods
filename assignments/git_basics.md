## Git Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to build your familarity with Git and to 
begin using GitHub as repository for your code. 

1. On GitHub create a repository with a README file for your materials for this
class. I do not care if it is private or public. However if you decide to create
a private repo then you must add me as a collaborator. To this on the home page
of your repository click on the settings button (a wrench and a screw driver)
and add my user name dmcglinn as a collaborator. 

2. Clone the repository to your local machine with the following command
`git clone https://github.com/your_user_name/your_repo_name.git` where you
replace "your_user_name" with your user name and "your_repo_name" with the repo
name you have chosen.

3. Copy and paste your class materials in this directory on your local machine

4. Stage and commit files to your repository and then push them to GitHub with
the command `git push origin master`

5. Send me a link to your repository.
