For this assignment will be analyzing the Tallgrass Prairie dataset:

<http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E091/124/>

1. Carry out a PCA on the Tallgrass prairie soil dataset.  The dataset can be found
here <http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E091/124/TGPP_env.csv>. The soil variables 
are represented by the variables PH to AL. 

Which variables are most strongly loading on axis 1? Axis 2? How many axes
are required to get the bulk of the variance (> 50%) of the soil variation?

How and why might you use the soil PCA axes rather than the raw soil variables in
a model?
