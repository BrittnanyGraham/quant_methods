## Intermediate R assignment

Now that you have some familiarity with R lets examine a few additional techniques.

1. The sum of a sequence. You have a vector "x" with the numbers 1:10. Write a
for loop that will produce a vector "y" that contains the sum of x up to that
index of x. So for example the elements are x are 1, 2, 3, and so on and the 
elements of y would be 1, 3, 6, and so on. 

2. Modify your for loop so that if the sum is greater than 10 the value of y
is set to NA

3. Place your for loop into a function that accepts as its argument any vector
of arbitrary length and it will return y.
